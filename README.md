cd <your-bff-dir-name>
sudo docker-compose build
sudo docker-compose up
```

### Start Dev Harness

Starting the harness will:

- Serve your component at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- Run and watch your tests

```bash
make
```

> `make` is an alias for `sudo docker-compose up` 

### Publishing Your Component to [npm.kroger.com](http://npm.kroger.com)

1. Update the following fields in your `package.json`
> It is recommended to start your component at version 1.0.0
```json
{
  "name": "my-component",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Cool awesome thing that my component does!"
  ... 
  // Don't edit anything else at this time
}
```

1. Check that you are using npm.kroger.com as your npm registry
> `npm get registry` should return http://npm.kroger.com/. If it's not
then run `npm set registry http://npm.kroger.com`

1. Run adduser to login to npm
> `npm adduser` and follow the prompts

1. Publish your component
> `npm publish`

1. When you make any changes, increment your package.json version.
>Follow the guideline: **Breaking.Feature.FixOrChore** when considering
your new version number. Then publish again.
